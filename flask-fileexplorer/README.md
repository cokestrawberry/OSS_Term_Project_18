**How to Run**
-
Clone this repository by using,
    
    git clone https://github.com/reallyrehan/flask-fileexplorer.git

Make sure you have flask installed. You can use the following command to install flask,

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
Now, open terminal/command prompt in the flask-fileexplorer directory and run the setup.py file by using the following command,

    python setup.py

You will have to configure the [config.json](config.json) file with your paths,

Example for Mac,

    "Favorites":    ["Users/rehanahmed/Downloads","Users/rehanahmed/Documents"],

Example for Windows,

    "Favorites":    ["C://Users//Administrator//Documents","C://Users//Administrator//Downloads"],


This should start the Flask Server in your terminal window. By default, it is run on port 80. You can access it by going to,
- **localhost** (on your server's browser)
- **(IP Address of your Server)** (from any other browser on the same network)

For additional features,

- **Password Protection**: Set a password in the config.json file.
- **Hiding Folders**: Add paths of folders to hide in the config.json file as a list.
- **Favorite Folders**: Add paths to add as favorites in the config.json file as a list.
- **Share only Specific Folder**: Give a path to the Root Directory or leave it as default '/' to share the complete computer directory.
